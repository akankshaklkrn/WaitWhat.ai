# WaitWhat.ai
AI-powered tool that detects confusing moments in demo videos using timestamped clarity analysis — with optional roast mode.

---

## 🚨 Problem
Great ideas fail not because they’re bad, but because the **demo explanation collapses under pressure**. Traditional feedback like “be clearer” or “slow down” is vague and not actionable.

---

## 💡 Solution
WaitWhat.ai analyzes demo videos and provides:

- ⏱️ Exact timestamps where clarity breaks
- 🧠 Detection of 6 clarity signals (rambling, grounding gaps, unsupported claims, etc.)
- 🔧 Actionable fixes for each flagged moment
- 🔥 Roast Mode (Kind → Honest → Brutal)
- 📈 A single clarity score summarizing the overall communication quality

---

## 🎥 How It Works

1. Upload demo or pitch video  
2. AI analyzes transcript and visual context  
3. View flagged segments with root-cause labels  
4. Jump to timestamps to see confusion in context  
5. Toggle Roast Mode to change feedback tone  
6. Review a rewritten pitch generated by AI

## 🧠 The 6 Clarity Signals

| Signal | Detects |
|--------|---------|
| **Concept Spike** | Too many buzzwords at once |
| **Grounding Gap** | Using terms before defining them |
| **Trust-Me-Bro** | Claims without proof or evidence |
| **Visual Mismatch** | Speech does not match what’s on screen |
| **Structure Order** | Disordered pitch structure |
| **Ramble Ratio** | Low information density & filler words |

## 🏗️ Architecture

Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind)
↓ Handles video upload
Backend (FastAPI + Python)
↓ TwelveLabs: Transcript + timestamps
↓ Gemini: Segment-level clarity analysis
↓ Risk scoring + issue generation
Frontend
↓ Video player with seek
↓ Issue list + roast mode
↓ Clarity score display

## 📊 Data Flow Summary

1. User uploads video  
2. Backend stores + sends to TwelveLabs  
3. Transcript + timestamps returned  
4. Transcript windowed into 10s segments  
5. Gemini analyzes each segment (terms, claims vs evidence, grounding, ramble ratio)  
6. Risk score calculated per segment  
7. JSON results returned to frontend

## 🧪 Example Output

```json
{
  "clarity_score": 63,
  "segments": [
    {
      "segment_id": 1,
      "start_sec": 10,
      "end_sec": 20,
      "label": "Buzzword Overdose",
      "fix": "Introduce acronyms before using them.",
      "tone": {
        "kind": "This part introduces multiple concepts quickly.",
        "honest": "Too many acronyms at once; define Marengo first.",
        "brutal": "Acronym speedrun detected. Confusion level: maximum."
      }
    }
  ]
}
